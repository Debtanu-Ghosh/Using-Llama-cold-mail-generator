# Cold-mail-generator

A software services company has built a tool using Groq, Langchain, and Streamlit. The tool lets users enter a company's career page URL. It then pulls job listings from the page and creates custom cold emails. These emails include links to portfolios, which are picked from a vector database based on the job descriptions.

**For example:**

Ram is looking for a Principal Software Engineer. They are spending a lot of time and money on hiring, onboarding, and training. ABC, a software development company, can provide Ram with a skilled engineer right away. Mohan, a business development executive from ABC, will send Ram a cold email offering their services.
